#Data Types

'''
Let's summarize what we have learned.

Integers are whole numbers, such as 8 and 42.
Floats are numbers with a decimal point, like 3.14.
Strings are text enclosed in single or double quotes

'''

String=("This is String")
print(String)

# Integer

print(8 + 4 - 2)
print(10 * 6)


# Floats
print(6 / 2)
print(8 / 3) 
print(225.56*2)

# 
print( (3**2)//2 )

 # String backslash
print('Brian\'s mother: He\'s not an angel. He\'s a very naughty boy!') 



#The backslash is also used to create new lines in text.
#To create a new line we use \n.
print("hii\nthere\nash")

'''Concatenation
In Python math works with words as well as numbers.
So not only can we add integers and floats, but also strings, using something called concatenation
which can be done on any two strings. Like this:'''

print('virat'+"kohli")
